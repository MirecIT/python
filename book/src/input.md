# Input

**Input** provides data on devices like a keyboard, a mouse and a controller. This data most importantly consists of buttons being pressed and buttons or devices being moved.

In games this data is used to activate certain events, for example:

- Pausing the game when the user presses escape.
- Moving the player when the user moves the joystick of a controller.

For these events to take place the game needs to check for any buttons that are pressed and take action accordingly.

This section explains how input works in Amethyst and how you can bind actions to user input.
