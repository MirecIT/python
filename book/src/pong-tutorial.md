# Pong Tutorial

To get a better feeling for how Amethyst works, we're going to implement a
Pong clone. You can find a [full Pong example][pong] (our end goal) in
Amethyst's [examples] folder. This tutorial breaks that project up into discrete
steps so it's easier to understand what everything is doing.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to follow the [Getting started chapter](./getting-started.html) before
starting with the tutorial / running the examples.

## Running the code after a chapter

If you've cloned the Amethyst repo, you can run any of the examples like so:

```norun
cargo run -p pong_tutorial_01
```

The example named `pong_tutorial_##` contains the code which you should have
after following all tutorials from 1 to ##.

[pong]: https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/tree/master/examples/pong_tutorial_06
